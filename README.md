# Entropic Physics System

This repository contains a terminal-based simulation of the Entropic Framework Physics Discovery System. It explores concepts of entropic physics, dimensional transitions, and emergent forces through a text-based interface.

## Features
- **Triad AI Discussion:** Engage with three AI personalities (Dr. Quantum, Prof. Dimensional, Dr. Consciousness) specializing in different aspects of physics.
- **Dynamic Physics Simulation:** Observe real-time changes in dimensions, particles, and emergent forces based on entropic parameters.
- **Physics Experiments:** Run simulated experiments like Bell Tests, Consciousness Collapse, and Goldilocks Zone mapping.
- **Novel Physics Injection:** Introduce random parameters to explore new physics regimes.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the `entropic_physics_system.py` file.
3. Run the script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 entropic_physics_system.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the simulation.

## Core Concepts
- **Entropy (ω):** A fundamental parameter influencing dimensional emergence and system stability.
- **Coupling (Γ):** Governs the interaction strength between various physical phenomena.
- **Consciousness (C):** An emergent property influencing quantum state collapse and observer effects.

## Equations
- **Core Equation:** `E = ∫ [ρ(χ,τ)·ω·∇σ] dⁿχ`
- **Lagrangian:** `ℒ = ½(∂ψ/∂τ)² - V(ψ) - ωρ∇²ψ + Γφη(ψ)`

Enjoy exploring the frontiers of entropic physics!
